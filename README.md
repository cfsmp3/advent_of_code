This is NOT production ready code :-)

It's a total mess - debug lines, solutions to part 2 of each day but not 1
(because I worked over the same code), non optimal or inadequate data
structures, horrible choice of variable names and so on. 

I'm sure much much more readable code is available so if you're trying to
learn - go find it!

I'm just creating this repo so I don't lose the code, it's a mess but
it's been fun.

PS. Since I'm not competing (I'm not around each day when it starts) my
commits will probably be late. Plus I'm traveling to Spain so I'll need to
catch up for days 14 and 15 at a later date.

All I promise is that all code is original.
